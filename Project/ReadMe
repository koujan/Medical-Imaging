This project presents a geodesic active contour
based segmentation technique for femur and tibia components
in the magnetic resonance images (MRI) of knee. Intensity and
local variance based Geodesic snake structures are used to
extract the bone features form the image. Initial seeds are
placed within the bone area on selected image slices. The
propagation of seeds is performed slice by slice to obtain the
final shape of the bone. The femoral and tibial cartilages are
extracted using region growing on correlation image of the
scan. The algorithm was tested on SKI 10 dataset, the results
of which are also discussed.
